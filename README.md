# Memory-Game
A memory game which almost everyone has played in "real life" where you need to remember which image was under which tile. Uncover all tiles with minimum moves possible. You can also choose between different levels of the game.

You can choose between easy, medium or difficult levels which display 4X4 , 4X5 and 4X6 tiles respectively. Click on the "New Game" button and you are good to go.

If at any point you feel stuck, you can quit your game and start a new one.

When you win, you will be displayed the number of turns taken by you to uncover all tiles.
